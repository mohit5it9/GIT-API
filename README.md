# GIT-API
User can input any link to a public github repository and corresponding to that total no of open issues will be displayed
For user shippable and repo support output can be seen at https://jsfiddle.net/hgphtc1b/6/

Whenever you enter say 'https://api.github.com/repos/shippable/support/issues' ; the data comes in form of JSON.Here shippable is the user name and support is one of it's repo. So using JS i have taken this JSON object into the script and then parsed the data according to last updated time.
